# What is a Minimum Viable Product?

A minimum viable product, or MVP, is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle.

## [Follow the following steps to build Frontend for MVP-P1](https://www.taniarascia.com/getting-started-with-react/)

Step 1 - To set up create-react-app, Run the following code in your terminal, 
          one directory up from where you want the project to live.
          
          npx create-react-app react-tutorial

Step 2 - Once that finishes installing, move to the newly created directory and start the project
           
         cd react-tutorial && npm start

Step 3 - Once you run this command, a new window will popup at localhost:3000 with your new React app.

         http://localhost:3000/
