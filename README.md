# What is a Minimum Viable Product?

A minimum viable product, or MVP, is a product with enough features to attract early-adopter customers and validate a product idea early in the product development cycle. In industries such as software, the MVP can help the product team receive user feedback as quickly as possible to iterate and improve the product.

Feel free to take a look. You might learn new things. They have been designed to provide a quick way to assess your knowledge and to save you time.

   [Server.js]()-> Root File where programmer can initlize  functions passed and will be executed when the client goes to the url http://localhost:5000<br/>
   [Mongo.js]() -> MongoDB is one of the most popular NoSQL databases around. It is fairly easy to use and understand when compared with SQL databases. But it is a                        schemaless database. When working with NodeJS, we can use mongoose ODM to define a schema for a MongoDB collection.<br/> A mongoose schema defines                      the shape of documents inside a particular collection.<br/>
   [Routes.js]()-> contains Route paths, in combination with a request method, define the endpoints at which requests can be made.<br/>
   [.env]()->      In simple term, it is a variable text file keep as secret and secure because in .env file we store our database password, username, API key etc‚Ä¶

## What to do after cloning code?
1. Run  npm install --> This is needed for installing node_modules. After Installing necessary Libraries move To step2 <br/>

2. Run  node server.js <br/>
 
3. Go to [Localhost](http://localhost:5000/) to view your backend <br/>


**Checklist before merging.**
<br/>1. Add all binaries in .git_ignore. They don't need to be commited. For example node_modules is not required.
